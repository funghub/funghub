# Hi, I'm Lawrence Fung

I work in bioinformatics, focusing on data analysis, computational biology, and projects improving human health.

## Featured Projects

- **[NGS Clustering](https://github.com/funghub/gene_expression_data-clustering)**  
  This R notebook will use statistical techniques to understand a NGS data set and compare gene expression by hierarchical clustering and k-means clustering. Explanations of the diagrams are included in the notebook.

- **[NGS Classification](https://github.com/funghub/gene_expression_data-classification)**  
  This R notebook takes a NGS data set and applies a binary classification method to sort out replicate1 and other replicates. Then this is plot on a ROC curve to explore different thresholds. The notebook also explores the use of confusion matrix to calculate specificity (tnr), sensitivity (tpr), and false positve rate. Explanations of the diagrams are included in the notebook.
